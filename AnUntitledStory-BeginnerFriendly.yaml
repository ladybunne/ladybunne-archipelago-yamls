  # Heck yeah you are!

  # Second, we'll local some items to help balance out the seed.
  local_items: [
    # Red Energy and Smash are both pretty big roadblocks. If we make them local,
    # it'll make it more likely that we can make meaningful progress without having
    # to wait too much.

    "Smash",

    # Here are some others you could turn on if you wanted to try something different.
    # Each will have varying consequences on how it skews the placement of items
    # in your seed though. If you're feeling spicy, give them a try!
