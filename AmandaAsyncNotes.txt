Special: The goal this time around is not to explore and log our worlds, but rather to become gods inside of them. Along with each yaml, you must submit one goal above and beyond your game's "goal." Ideally, this secondary goal will involve you obtaining, constructing, or otherwise finding an item that represents extreme power, or ostentatious wealth (though, I'm not too picky about it. If "wealth" to you is getting $100K in Stardew, that's fine.) Once you reach your game's "goal," you will pursue this secondary goal. Once you reach the secondary goal, submit a screenshot and a brief explanation of your achievement, after which I will release your game. Rather than just hoarding short stories from everyone, this time I'm going to make a collage of all our screenshots at the end of the async.
