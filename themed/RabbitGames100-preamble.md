At last, it's come time to announce the theme of the Rabbit Games: Episode 100!


This game's theme is:
# Down the Rabbit Hole
** **

### __The Premise__

Through the power of a villainous rabbit's :sparkles: _meta yaml nonsense_ :sparkles:, the multiworld's most important items have been unceremoniously tossed down a number of holes! 

For this game, **all subterranean-themed checks will be PRIORITY locations**. Broadly, this includes:
- Any check whose name contains at least one of these words: `(cave|cavern|mine|hole|pit|chasm)`.
- Any check that is otherwise in a subterranean area _(e.g. Cavern of Remembrance in KH2)_, UNLESS the majority of the game is subterranean.
- Any check that, for open world games, _must_ be done underground _(e.g. Jeepers Creepers in Terraria, Sneak 100 in Minecraft)_.

The `meta.yaml` will be uploaded ASAP once it's done, and pinned for visibility.

### __Eligibility__

For your game to be eligible, it must meet at least ONE of the following criteria:
1. The game is subterranean-themed.
2. The game has at least one check whose name includes at least of the following words: `(cave|cavern|mine|hole|pit|chasm)`.
3. The game has at least one check in an otherwise-hole-or-cave-themed place.

If your game does not meet any of these criteria, it will not be allowed in this multiworld. For a full list of allowed games, see [this spreadsheet](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ezwBABhi8YgqEKJamY6CYm1GMuz6anMLcdE7qceam-4/edit?usp=sharing>).

_(List subject to discussion and changes. If something looks wrong, please let me know!)_

### __The Rest__

[Usual Rabbit Games rules](<https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1223419796087898144/1224549904630808596>), basically, except it's three hours instead of two, so 2h 30min target time for yamls instead of 1h 30min.
