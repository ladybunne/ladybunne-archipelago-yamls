description: Ladybunne's Z1 plando key concept thing

name: Ladybunne{NUMBER}
game: The Legend of Zelda

requires:
  version: 0.5.0
  plando: items

# So! The broad idea with this is that it's a semi-plando run where the structure of the
# game is quite different, due to manual placement of keys.
#
# The game is intended to not be beatable without the Magical Key. I'm going to do plando
# shenanigans to ensure that there are not enough keys to reach Gannon without it, and
# from there, I can do some cool stuff with it being a sort of "Lucky Emblem hunt," a la
# KH2, where you need to get enough heart containers to get the Magical Key, which lets you
# beat the game.
#
# Some stuff will still be random (items like Bow, Recorder, Stepladder, Food and such).

  # Design notes:
  # - Use Letter to have some cool items, but can't put a heart there because it 
  #   would be infinitely purchaseable.
  # - Maybe make Letter be the bomb shop? That's a fun thought.
