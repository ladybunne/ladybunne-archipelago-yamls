Risk of Rain 2:

  # Force these locations to be junk. The main reason to do this is twofold: 
  # - It lets RoR2 hoover up bad items for other players.
  # - It excludes late chest checks (since they take a long time), without 
  #   shrinking the amount of items RoR2 adds to the pool.

  # I'm super mixed on this.
  # - Every chest is obviously terrible, it breaks the game.
  # - Every second feels like it eats a lot of your items.
  # - Every third is... weird. You send less checks but you do actually get to play
  #   the game.
